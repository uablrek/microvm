# microvm - with firecracker and qemu-microvm

A "microvm" is a very lightweight VM. From QEMU docs:

> Itâ€™s a minimalist machine type without PCI nor ACPI support, designed for short-lived guests.

This repo describes howto create `microvm` kernels and images
compatible with [firecracker](
https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker) and
[qemu-microvm](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/i386/microvm.html)

**NOTE:** Tested on `Ubuntu 24.04 LTS`. It may, or may not work on
other distros. Please raise an issue to make other users aware of any problem,
and please file a PR to fix the problem if possible.


## Setup and the microvm.sh script

Prerequisites: `jq` and `kvm/qemu` are installed.

Most things are done using the `microvm.sh` script.
```
./microvm.sh        # Help printout
./microvm.sh env    # Print current environment (check versions)
# (download archives if needed)
./microvm.sh setup  # Install items in $MICROVM_WORKSPACE
```

Download archives from:

* https://kernel.org/
* https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases/
* https://www.alpinelinux.org/downloads/
* https://github.com/lgekman/diskim/releases

## Quick start

The kernel must be built locally and an [Alpine Linux](
https://www.alpinelinux.org/) rootfs is used by default. Images are built
with [diskim](https://github.com/lgekman/diskim).

```
eval $(./microvm.sh env | grep __image) # (or; export __image=/path/to/rootfs.img
./microvm.sh kernel_build
./microvm.sh mkimage ./templates/alpine
ls -slh $__image   # This is a "sparse" file, not really 2G
# Start and login as "root" (no passwd)
./microvm.sh run_microvm
# (exit with ctrl-C)
./microvm.sh run_fc
# (exit with "kill 1")
```


## Networking

A `tun/tap` device is used since [firecracker only supports that](
https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/main/docs/network-setup.md).
The tap device (and an optional bridge) must be created before the vm
is started. Then the `--tap=` option can be specified to the run command.

```
./microvm.sh mktap --adr=172.20.0.1/24 tap0   # (requires sudo)
./microvm.sh run_microvm --tap=tap0
# Or:
./microvm.sh run_fc --tap=tap0
# In the console
ip link    # You should see a "lo" and "eth0" interface (both DOWN)
```

This will *not* setup any networking in the guest. You can do that
manually.

```
# In the console:
ip link set up eth0
ip addr add 172.20.0.2/24 dev eth0
ping -c1 -W1 172.20.0.1     # Ping the host
```


## The rootfs

You can build you own customized root file system by setting the
`--rootfsar=` option and add "overlays", i.e. archives or directories
that will be copied to your root file system. The `rootfsar` must be
in `$HOME/Downloads` or `$ARCHIVE`.

```
./microvm.sh mkimage --rootfsar=alpine-minirootfs-3.19.1-x86_64.tar.gz --image=/tmp/alpine.img ./templates/alpine
```

This takes an Alpine rootfs (unmodified) and add the files under
`./templates/alpine`.



## Minimum kernel config

This section describes how to build a minimum kernel that can be used
with `microvm`. Read also about the [Linux Kernel Tinification project](
https://archive.kernel.org/oldwiki/tiny.wiki.kernel.org/).

```
builddir=/tmp/$USER/minivm
mkdir -p $builddir
export __kcfg=$builddir/kernel.conf
export __kobj=$builddir/obj
./microvm.sh kernel_build --tinyconfig  # (will clear the config)
# just exit the kernel config and let it build
ls -lh $__kobj/arch/x86/boot/bzImage # (549K for linux-6.16.0 at the time of writing)
```

You have now built an as small Linux kernel as possible. It is totally
useless, but may be interresting for minimalists (like myself).

The configuration described below is a minimum config to get a rootfs
and a serial console.

```
./microvm.sh kernel_build --menuconfig
# Enter:
[*] 64-bit kernel
General setup >
  Configure standard kernel features (expert users) >
    [*]   Enable support for printk
[*] Enable the block layer
Executable file formats >
  [*] Kernel support for ELF binaries
  [*] Kernel support for scripts starting with #!
Device Drivers >
  Character devices >
    [*] Enable TTY
    [ ] (unmark Virtual terminal and others)
    Serial drivers >
      [*] 8250/16550 and compatible serial support
      [*]   Console on 8250/16550 and compatible serial port
  [*] Virtio drivers >
    [*]   Platform bus driver for memory mapped virtio devices
    [*]     Memory mapped virtio devices parameter parsing
  Block devices >
    [*]   Virtio block driver  
File systems >
  [*] The Extended 4 (ext4) filesystem
```

Unmark unnecessary things.


Test it:
```
ls -lh $__kernel    # (981K for linux-6.16.0 at the time of writing)
./microvm.sh run_microvm --mem=32 --init=/bin/sh
# (exit with ctrl-C)
./microvm.sh run_fc --mem=32 --init=/bin/sh
# (exit with "exit")
```

If you *really* want to learn about Linux kernel configuration, this
is a good place to start IMHO. Configure support for `procfs`,
`sysfs`, `kvmclock` and multi-user to start without
`--init=/bin/sh`.

```
./microvm.sh kernel_build --menuconfig
# Enter:
General setup >
  Configure standard kernel features (expert users) >
    [*]   Multiple users, groups and capabilities support
Processor type and features >
  [*] Symmetric multi-processing support
  [*] Linux guest support >
    [*]   Enable paravirtualization code
    [*]   KVM Guest support (including kvmclock)
File systems >
  Pseudo filesystems >
    [*] /proc file system support
    [*] sysfs file system support
```

Test:
```
./microvm.sh run_microvm
# (exit with ctrl-C)
./microvm.sh run_fc
# (exit with "kill 1")
```

### Networking

```
./microvm.sh kernel_build --menuconfig
# Enter:
[*] Networking support >
  Networking options >
    [*] Packet socket
    [*] Unix domain sockets
    [*] TCP/IP networking
      [*] The IPv6 protocol (NEW)
Device Drivers >
  [*] Network device support >
    [*] Virtio network driver
  [ ] Ethernet driver support
```

NOTE: for some reason "Unix domain sockets" is required to make "ip" work!

Test as described above.


### Other things

This is a *very* limited kernel. You must probably configure *a lot*
more to get a kernel useful for you purpose. Here are some examples:

```
General setup >
  [*] Control Group support
    [*] Memory controller
    [*]   CPU controller
  [*] Namespaces support
  Configure standard kernel features (expert users) >
    [*] Posix Clocks & timers
    [*] BUG() support 
    [*] Enable futex support
    [*] Enable eventpoll support
Processor type and features >
  [*] Symmetric multi-processing support
Memory Management options >
  [ ] Support for paging of anonymous memory (swap)
Networking support >
  Networking options >
    [*] IP: multicasting 
    [*] 802.1Q/802.1ad VLAN Support
    [*] 802.1d Ethernet Bridging
    [*] Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter) >
      (whatever you need here...)
Device Drivers >
  Network device support >
    [*] MAC-VLAN support
    [*] IP-VLAN support
    [*] Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN)
    [*] Universal TUN/TAP device driver support
    [*] Virtual ethernet pair device
```

## Document kernel configs

To just store the configs works, but they are hard to get a grasp
of. The Linux kernel is *huge* and it's hard to go through the
menuconfig and try to figure out what's in there and why. Often you
end up with an unnecessary large configuration.

I have copied the menuconfig above, but that is tedious and error
prone. Another way is to use the `scripts/config` script in the linux
kernel. Example:

```
cd /path/to/kernel
./scripts/config --enable 64BIT
```

To start with `tinyconfig` (`allnoconfig` actually configures *much*
more) and document a series of `scripts/config` makes it easy for
anyone to see what's configured and re-create the configuration. After
configuring this way, you must run `menuconfig`, and just exit. This
to let the kernel build system fill in dependencies.

```
export __kcfg=/tmp/kernel-test.cfg  # (or whatever)
./microvm.sh kernel_build --tinyconfig # (just exit menuconfig)
./microvm.sh kernel-config config/minimal.cfg config/multi-user.cfg config/network.cfg
./microvm.sh kernel_build --menuconfig # (just exit)
```

An alternative to `scripts/config` is [Kconfiglib](
https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/Kconfiglib). You can clone it,
set `$kconfiglib` to point at the clone, and use `--kconfiglib` to try
it.
